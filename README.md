# Mechanistic_ML_model
This Repository shows the code used for my second part of my Thesis in which I tried to estimate the Time to relapse (TTR) of GBM patients using the in-house dataset. I first performed the analysis and prepared the dataset for the furthur operations. The main idea is derived from the paper as:
Mascheroni, Pietro, et al. "Improving personalized tumor growth predictions using a Bayesian combination of mechanistic modeling and machine learning." Communications medicine 1.1 (2021): 19.

I tried different methods to obtain a good approximation of the time to relapse, however, due to the low amount of data (n = 17 patients), we couldnt obtain the promising results.
